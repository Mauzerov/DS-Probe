1. I don't want to carry another person through this course.
2. Neither do i want to be sandbagged by another person (if forced to work in a team).
3. Working in teams with people who don't know git(hub) is painfull.
4. If working in teams is mandatory to learn how to operate in a team, I already worked a lot in a team:

5. In regards to 1. & 2. working in this way doesn't benefit anyone, working in this way is also time-consuming, annoing, and not efficent.
6. If you really want me to work in a team (pair) you have to find someone for me, I am not so good at social interactions, never bothered making friends or any relationship as it went badly in the past, only people I talk to are in other group (and made a team within themselfs), so another option would be to move me there and make a bigger group.
